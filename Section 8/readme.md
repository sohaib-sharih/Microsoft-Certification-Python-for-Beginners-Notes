        <li><b>While loops</b> run forever until the condition is changed to false. The conditions need to keep changing as well, otherwise the while loop will run forever, until the program crashes.</li>
        <li><b>For loops are used for lists</b>. This allows python to <b>iterate the items in a loop.</b></li>
        <li>Python lists are <b>iterable</b> and they can be looped over using for loops.</li>
        <li><b>sleep function</b> can be used to add a second delay before it runs the 2nd loop.</li>
