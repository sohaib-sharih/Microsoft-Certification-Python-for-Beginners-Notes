<h1>Python introduction</h1>
    <ol type="1">
        <li><b>Packages</b> are shared code libraries freely available to use for python developers.</li>
        <li><b>interpreted language</b> which means the code is interpreted line by line.</li>
        <li>Python runtime environment can be run in two ways to execute:
            <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Interactive mode</b> that allows you to run the code automatically each time you press <i>enter</i>.</li>
                <li><b>Compile mode</b> allows you to write your code statements first, then you need to run the python interpreter by pointing it to the file name. There are no compilation steps as shown below: <br>

    </ol>



<h1>REPL Read-Eval-Print-Loop</h1>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>When you want to run a few lines of code just to test a code, python allows you to do it through REPL mode, without having to create a <b>file</b>.</li>
        <li> To run the REPL mode, simply go to the Terminal and type <b>python</b> then you can use <b>help()</b> command followed by the <b>subject</b> or <b>topic</b></li>
        <li>You can quit by CTRL + C or simply press Q</li>
        
</ol>

<h1>Variables and basics of Python</h1>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Values are stored in <b>variables</b> that reserve a <b>memory.</b> to store the variable value.</li>
        <li>Variables are one of the fundamental building blocks of programs written in Python. Variables hold data in memory. They have names, and they can be referenced by those names. Variables also have types, which specify what type of data they can store (such as string and integer), and they can be used in expressions that use operators (such as + and -) to manipulate their values.</li>
        <li>This is because Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that it recognises the <b>datatype</b> of the variable value by itself. </li>

<h1>Reading Keyboard input</h1>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>There are many ways to send input to a program; two common ways are via a graphical interface or a console.</li>

<h1>Installation and setting up of Python environment BAAICA</h1>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>installing Python latest version is important because you will need the Python interpreter to read your code/program, and it helps compiles and runs your code.</li>
        <li>You can install python directly from their website or use the Microsoft Store to install for free.</li>
        <li>md hello-world CMD is used to create a directory, you can check the directory using <b>cd 'nameOfFolder'</b>.</li>
        <li>cd .. will take you backwards by 1 step to folder location.</li>
        <li>file extension to use is .py</li>
        
</ol>



<h1>INstallation of Anaconda and other extensions.</h1>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Extensions need to be installed as shown below: <br>
            <img src="/images/ex1.PNG" alt=""> <br>
            <img src="/images/ex2.PNG" alt=""> <br>

            <img src="/images/ex4.PNG" alt="">
        </li>
        <li>Install Anaconda</li>
        <li>Install Python 3 or latest version, to check current version, type py--version or Python --version</li>
        <li>use a file extension called  <b>ipynb</b> to run a program file using jupyter and anaconda</li>
        <li>PIP is used to create a local environment to run through an isolated environment.</li>

</ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>You'll use the Azure Cloud Shell to develop with Python in this module, but the summary has links to download and install Python on your local computer once you've completed this module.</li>
    </ol>
